## Configuration

This workflow uses the following environment variables:

- `transmission_web_url` (default to `http://localhost:9091/transmission/rpc`): this is the url of Transmission remote access.
- `rerun` (default to `1`): after how much seconds do we want to refresh the results (should be between `0.1` and `5`)? This variable is directly passed to the output of alfred to use rerun feature.
